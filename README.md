       dune-release browse issues # Review remaining outstanding issues
       dune-release status        # Review the changes since last version

### Important Notes

Most of the code in this repository has been written by
Daniel BÃ¼nzli and has already been released part of the
[topkg](http://erratique.ch/software/topkg) tool.

`dune-release` removes the IPC layer of `topkg` and bundle everything
as a single binary. It removes the need to define `pkg/pkg.ml` and
assumes that the package is built using
[dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune).
